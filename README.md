# Example Phaser.io Top down shooter game

Attempts at the game for CSC309

### Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts. Forgot to .gitignore node modules in the fork so for some reason the node modules are here still?

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
