# Example Phaser.io Top down shooter game

Attempts at the game for CSC309. Concept: Battle Royale Top down shooter.
Made using PhaserJS, npm to install scripts, webpack to display on the browser, and babel to transpile ES6.

### Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts. Forgot to .gitignore node modules in the fork so for some reason the node modules are here still?

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
